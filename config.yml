about_me      : |
  I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in building intelligent, scalable systems that translate complex data into tangible business impact. With a deep focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), I thrive on architecting solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world application.

  My current work involves developing advanced Graph-RAG systems to enhance information retrieval and building multimodal AI assistants for complex triage scenarios. I'm passionate about open-source and believe that constraints breed creativity.
